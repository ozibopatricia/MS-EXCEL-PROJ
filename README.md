# MS-EXCEL-PROJ
# Project 1 
# The dataset U.S superstore 
I started the analysis by importing the dataset into Excel.  I checked for missing values in each column, and I also looked out for duplicated rows to ensure data integrity. 
The goal of this project is yo keep track of the revenue across different segments, months , quarters, and months.
This will help us understand where the lapses came from and how to resolve them.

# Key questions 
1. How do sales vary by month 
2. How do sales vary by region
3. Sales by quarters 
4. Sales by segment 
5. How do products sold vary by month
6. Total revenue for the entire year
7. Sum of discount by month
