## MS-EXCEL-PROJ 
# The dataset is the U.S. superstore 
I started the analysis by importing the dataset into Excel.  I checked for missing values and blank cells in each column, and I also looked out for duplicated rows to ensure data integrity. 
The goal of this project is to keep track of the revenue across different segments, months , quarters, and months.
This will help us understand where the lapses came from and how to resolve them.

## Problem Statement 
1. Total revenue for the years 
2. Average sales by region
3. Average sales by quarters 
4. Sales by segment 
5. How do products sold vary by month?
6. Top 3 customers with highest discount


## Data visualization
1. column chart to represent the average sales by quarters 
2. line chart to represent the products sold by month
3. bar chart to represent total profit by segment 
4. column to represent discount by top 3 customers
5. pie chart to represent sales by region
6. A bar chart to represent total revenue for the years
